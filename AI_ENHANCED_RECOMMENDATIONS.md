# 🤖 AI-Enhanced Credit Card Recommendation System

## 📊 **Current System Analysis**

### **❌ Problems with Current System**

1. **No AI Integration**: Uses basic rule-based algorithms
2. **Inaccurate Point Values**: Fixed point values (often 1:1) don't reflect reality
3. **Poor Category Detection**: Limited merchant categorization
4. **Static Recommendations**: Doesn't adapt to user behavior patterns
5. **No Risk Assessment**: Doesn't warn about potential issues
6. **Basic Scoring**: Simple mathematical formulas without context

### **💰 Point Value Issues**
- Chase UR points worth 1.25¢ in portal, 2.1¢ when transferred optimally
- Amex MR points worth 0.6¢ for cashback, 2.2¢ for transfers
- Current system: Fixed 1.25¢ regardless of redemption method
